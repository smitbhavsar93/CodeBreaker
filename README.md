# CodeBreaker

## Description
This is the codeBreaker.java program. This program creates a random sequence of characters using the letters GRBYOP (Green, Red, Blue, Yellow, Orange and Purple) to a length defined by a constant that can be changed within the program. The program will first ask the user to enter their first guess, if it is valid,  the game will progress on, if its not valid, then the program re-asks the user to enter a valid guess until it becomes valid. The user has 10 guesses to guess  the random code.
