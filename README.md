# CodeBreaker
My final culminating project in my final year at high school. It wasn't the most high tech culminating, but given the circumstances we were in, it was pretty difficult to code and in the well got a working code that illustrates the real CodeBreaker game.

## Description
This is the codeBreaker.java program. This program creates a random sequence of characters using the letters GRBYOP (Green, Red, Blue, Yellow, Orange and Purple) to a length defined by a constant that can be changed within the program. The program will first ask the user to enter their first guess, if it is valid,  the game will progress on, if its not valid, then the program re-asks the user to enter a valid guess until it becomes valid. The user has 10 guesses to guess  the random code.

## How to run code
For this code to work, drag and drop the .java file into any java programming compiler, the code for us was written on a software called Eclipse.

## Eclipse
This program was coded on Eclipse, to download Eclipse, visit : https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/ and download their latest release on your compatible device.
